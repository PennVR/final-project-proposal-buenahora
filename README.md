## Fire Emergency Simulator
This VR application aims at preparing students for fire emergencies as a substitute to fire drills. The user starts in an office building or school (that is ideally procedurally generated and maze-like). The building is initially on fire and the goal is to escape the building following appropriate protocol. There will be panicked AI that is also trying to escape the building. When a user doesn't follow appropriate protocol (say running when their clothes is on fire), then a warning will appear on the screen with to correct the user. Ideally this simulation is gamified with different levels of difficulty. The most difficult levels might have more people, a faster fire, a stronger initial fire, another disaster like an earthquake, locked doors, bigger building, etc.

## Cooking Simulator
This VR application intends to teach the user how to cook different meals. The setting is a large kitchen with many different cooking tools, a stove, oven, fridge w/ ingredients, etc. The application will be gamified by providing a list of recipes of varying difficulties. After a user selects an ingredient, they will be presented with a list of steps, where each step highlights the necessary tools / ingredients in the virtual world. The application will aid the user by providing a timer, tips, and similar tool-tips. The food would need to react appropriately to the user's actions, so that the final result can be both a failure and success. As a final caveat, this concept would serve as a very cool proof-of-concept for an application that may one day be possible in AR, which would be incredibly useful.

## VR Social App Focused on Elderly
This VR application will be similar to existing VR social applications, except that the target audience is the elderly which are traditionally lonlier. The focus of this application is to empower people in an interface and controls that are easy to understand. There will be certain activities in this VR that provide a structured way for these people to interact (say a concert, or bingo). Users will be able to make new friendships and maintain existing ones, by being able to add and message friends.
