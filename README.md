## Fire Emergency Simulator
This VR application aims at preparing students for fire emergencies as a substitute to fire drills. The user starts in an office building or school (that is ideally procedurally generated and maze-like). The building is initially on fire and the goal is to escape the building following appropriate protocol. There will be panicked AI that is also trying to escape the building. When users don't follow appropriate protocol (say running when their clothes is on fire), then a warning will appear on the screen with correct procedures or stats that educate. Ideally this simulation is gamified with different levels of difficulty. The most difficult levels might have more people, a faster fire, a stronger initial fire, another disaster like an earthquake, locked doors, etc.
